##🚀 Why Docker Is Popular for Containerization
#1. Simplicity and Developer-Friendliness
Docker makes it easy to package applications with all their dependencies into a single container.

You can define everything using a simple Dockerfile.

#2. Consistency Across Environments
Docker containers behave exactly the same in development, testing, and production.

"It works on my machine" is no longer a problem.

#3. Lightweight and Fast
Containers share the host OS kernel — so they’re much lighter and faster than full virtual machines (VMs).

You can start, stop, or restart containers in seconds.

#4. Docker Hub Ecosystem
Huge library of pre-built images (like MySQL, NGINX, Node.js) on Docker Hub.

This saves time and effort when setting up services.

#5. Standardization
Docker uses open standards (like OCI), and is supported by most cloud providers and tools (Kubernetes, CI/CD systems, etc.).

It became the de facto standard, so other tools support it out of the box.

#6. Strong Tooling and Community
Rich ecosystem (e.g., docker-compose, Docker Desktop).

Massive community for help and tutorials.

Lots of integrations with CI/CD, cloud, orchestration (Kubernetes), etc.

## 🛠️ **What is Ansible?**

**Ansible** is an **open-source IT automation tool** used to:

* Set up (provision) servers
* Install software
* Manage configurations
* Deploy applications
* Orchestrate complex workflows across multiple machines

Ansible is developed by **Red Hat** and is very popular for **DevOps** and **cloud automation**.

---

## 💡 Why is Ansible Used for Automation (Compared to Others)?

Here’s **why people choose Ansible** over other tools (like Puppet, Chef, Salt, or scripts):

---

### ✅ 1. **Agentless** (No software needed on servers)

* Ansible uses **SSH** to connect to servers — you don’t need to install anything on the target machines.
* This makes it **simple and lightweight** to use.

---

### ✅ 2. **Simple to Learn (Uses YAML)**

* Ansible uses **YAML** files for automation scripts (called **playbooks**).
* Very readable, even if you're not a programmer.

📝 Example:

```
yaml
- name: Install NGINX
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install NGINX package
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Idempotent** (Safe to run multiple times)

* Ansible makes sure the system ends up in the **desired state**, no matter how many times you run it.
* It won’t re-do work that’s already done.

---

### ✅ 4. **Powerful and Scalable**

* You can manage **one server or thousands** with the same playbook.
* Perfect for cloud environments (AWS, Azure, etc.).

---

### ✅ 5. **Huge Community + Lots of Modules**

* Prebuilt modules for managing almost anything (Linux, Windows, cloud, databases, containers, etc.).
* Strong support and documentation.

---

## 🆚 Ansible vs. Other Automation Tools

| Feature           | **Ansible** | Puppet / Chef        | Bash Scripts        |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Agentless         | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No (agents needed) | ✅ Yes               |
| Easy to Read      | ✅ YAML      | ❌ DSL (harder)       | ❌ Not very readable |
| Idempotent        | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                |
| Cloud Integration | ✅ Strong    | ✅ Medium             | ⚠️ Manual setup     |
| Learning Curve    | ✅ Easy      | ❌ Steeper            | ✅ Easy (but messy)  |

---

## 🧠 Summary

**Ansible is used** for automation because:

* It’s **easy, agentless, and powerful**
* Uses **simple YAML files**
* Works great for **provisioning, config management, and app deployment**
* Widely adopted in DevOps and cloud automation

 **detailed, step-by-step guide** 
📌 **“JIRA Software Deployment in Containers using Ansible and Docker”**
Using: **AWS EC2, Control Node, Worker Nodes, Ansible, Docker, and Terminal**

---

## 🧱 Project Architecture

```
[Control Node (EC2)]
    |
    | SSH + Ansible
    v
[Worker Node 1 (EC2)] <--- Docker + JIRA
[Worker Node 2 (EC2)] <--- Docker + JIRA
```

---

## 🔴 Step 1: **Create EC2 Instances in AWS**

Create 3 EC2 Instances:

| Role         | Count | OS                      | Ports                 |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Control Node | 1     | Amazon Linux 2 / Ubuntu | 22 (SSH)              |
| Worker Nodes | 2     | Amazon Linux 2 / Ubuntu | 22 (SSH), 8080 (JIRA) |

### ✅ Instructions:

1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard → Launch Instance**
2. Choose **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu 22.04**
3. Instance type: `t2.medium` or higher
4. Configure **key pair** (download `.pem` file)
5. Configure **Security Group**:

   * Allow:

     * TCP 22 (SSH)
     * TCP 8080 (for JIRA UI)
     * TCP 80 (optional HTTP)
6. Launch 3 instances: 1 for control, 2 for workers

---

## 🔵 Step 2: **Connect to EC2 Instances via Terminal**

### On your local terminal:

```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem  # Make key secure

# Control node
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<control-node-public-ip>

# Worker nodes
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<worker-node-1-public-ip>
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<worker-node-2-public-ip>
```

---

## 🟢 Step 3: **Install Docker on Worker Nodes**

Repeat on each **worker node**:

### For Amazon Linux:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
```

### For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

---

## 🟣 Step 4: **Install Ansible on the Control Node**

SSH into **Control Node** and run:

### Amazon Linux:

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable ansible2
sudo yum install -y ansible
```

### Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible
```

---

## 🟤 Step 5: **Set Up Ansible Inventory**

On control node:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
```

Add:

```ini
[jira-nodes]
<worker-node-1-private-ip>
<worker-node-2-private-ip>
```

> You can get private IPs from EC2 dashboard.

---

## 🟠 Step 6: **Enable Passwordless SSH from Control Node to Workers**

### 1. On Control Node:

```bash
ssh-keygen  # Press enter to all prompts
ssh-copy-id ec2-user@<worker-node-1-private-ip>
ssh-copy-id ec2-user@<worker-node-2-private-ip>
```

(If using Ubuntu AMI, replace `ec2-user` with `ubuntu`.)

---

## 🔵 Step 7: **Create Ansible Playbook to Deploy JIRA**

### On the Control Node, create the playbook:

```bash
mkdir ~/jira-deploy && cd ~/jira-deploy
vi deploy_jira.yml
```

### Paste this into the file:

```yaml
- name: Deploy JIRA Software using Docker
  hosts: jira-nodes
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: Ensure Docker is installed
      package:
        name: docker
        state: present

    - name: Start Docker service
      service:
        name: docker
        state: started
        enabled: true

    - name: Pull JIRA Docker image
      docker_image:
        name: atlassian/jira-software
        source: pull

    - name: Run JIRA container
      docker_container:
        name: jira
        image: atlassian/jira-software
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - /opt/jira-home:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira
```

---

## 🟣 Step 8: **Run the Ansible Playbook**

On the control node:

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy_jira.yml
```

This will:

* Ensure Docker is running
* Pull the JIRA container
* Run the JIRA container on both worker nodes

---

## 🟢 Step 9: **Access JIRA in Your Browser**

Open this URL in your browser:

```bash
http://<worker-node-1-public-ip>:8080
```

And/or

```bash
http://<worker-node-2-public-ip>:8080
```

---

## 🛠️ Optional Tweaks

* **Persistent storage**: Mount EBS to `/opt/jira-home`
* **Reverse proxy**: Use NGINX or ALB
* **HTTPS**: Add SSL with Certbot or behind ALB
* **Auto-scaling**: Integrate with AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* JIRA startup takes a few minutes
* First-time setup is through web UI
* You can configure PostgreSQL instead of internal DB for production

---





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *step-by-step guide to create a custom VPC and subnet** in AWS, and then launch your Control Node and Worker Nodes within it. This ensures **all nodes are in the same isolated network**—a best practice for internal communication (like Ansible SSH access).

---

## 🧱 STEP-BY-STEP: Create VPC and Subnet in AWS

You’ll create:

* A **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
* A **Subnet**
* An **Internet Gateway**
* A **Route Table**
* And finally **EC2 instances** inside that VPC/subnet

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Go to VPC Dashboard

1. Login to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Search and go to **“VPC”** service

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a Custom VPC

1. In the VPC dashboard, click **“Create VPC”**
2. Choose:

   * **Name tag**: `JIRA-VPC`
   * **IPv4 CIDR block**: `10.0.0.0/16`
   * Keep rest as default (no IPv6, no DNS hostname required)
3. Click **“Create VPC”**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Create a Subnet

1. Click **“Subnets” → “Create subnet”**
2. Fill details:

   * **Name tag**: `JIRA-Subnet`
   * **VPC ID**: Select `JIRA-VPC`
   * **Availability Zone**: Pick any (e.g., `us-east-1a`)
   * **IPv4 CIDR block**: `10.0.1.0/24`
3. Click **“Create subnet”**

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Create Internet Gateway (for SSH/Internet access)

1. In the sidebar, click **“Internet Gateways” → “Create internet gateway”**
2. Fill:

   * **Name tag**: `JIRA-IGW`
3. Click **“Create”**
4. Then click **“Attach to VPC”** and select `JIRA-VPC`

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Configure Route Table

1. Go to **Route Tables** → Find the one created with your VPC

   * Name it: `JIRA-RT`
2. Select it → go to **Routes tab** → Click **“Edit routes”**
3. Add a new route:

   * **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
   * **Target**: `Internet Gateway` → Select `JIRA-IGW`
4. Save

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Associate Route Table with Subnet

1. Still inside the `JIRA-RT` route table
2. Go to **“Subnet Associations” → “Edit subnet associations”**
3. Select `JIRA-Subnet`
4. Click **“Save associations”**

---

## ✅ Now Your VPC Network is Ready

| Component       | Value            |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| VPC CIDR        | 10.0.0.0/16      |
| Subnet CIDR     | 10.0.1.0/24      |
| Internet Access | Via attached IGW |
| Route           | 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW  |

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Launch EC2 Instances (Control + Workers)

1. Go to **EC2 → Launch Instance**
2. Launch 3 instances:

   * **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2
   * **Instance type**: `t2.medium`
   * **Network**: Select `JIRA-VPC`
   * **Subnet**: Select `JIRA-Subnet`
   * **Auto-assign Public IP**: Enable (so you can SSH)
   * Create or select an existing key pair
3. Use different **Name tags**:

   * `Ansible_Control`
   * `Worker_Node_1`
   * `Worker_Node_2`

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Create Security Groups (during instance launch or separately)

#### For Control Node:

| Type | Port | Source       |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| SSH  | 22   | Your IP only |

#### For Worker Nodes:

| Type | Port | Source                                        |
| ---- | ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| SSH  | 22   | Control node **private IP** OR security group |
| SSH  | 22   | Your IP (optional, for direct login)          |
| TCP  | 8080 | Your IP (for JIRA UI)                         |

💡 You can allow SSH from the Control Node's **Security Group** instead of IP if easier:

* Source = "Ansible-Control SG"

---

## ✅ Summary

| Resource      | Name          | Notes                         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| VPC           | `JIRA-VPC`    | 10.0.0.0/16                   |
| Subnet        | `JIRA-Subnet` | 10.0.1.0/24                   |
| IGW           | `JIRA-IGW`    | Internet access               |
| Route Table   | `JIRA-RT`     | Routes internet to IGW        |
| EC2 Instances | 3 total       | Control Node + 2 Worker Nodes |
| Public IPs    | Enabled       | For SSH and Web UI access     |
